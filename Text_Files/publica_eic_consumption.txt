what he acribes to the nation concerns this nation than all the ret of europe becaue all of them put together conume not one fourth of thoe commodities this bill prohibits that we do and that the lays upon the collective body of europe does bear hard only upon thoe countries which conume the indian commodities without having any hare in the traffic to this i anwer it in the traffic to this i anwer it is equally o to us when we conume more of them at home than we end abroad of our native commodities to purchae i doubt he cannot prove they end out money to pay for the commodities we conume of india which this bill is to prohibit the wear of in england he omits have free liberty of hipping them out to thoe countries he would make us believe conume o much of them i believe he would be more ingenuous in this matter if than ten times the trade we have to the east-indies yet the whole netted provinces conume not o much of the commodities this bill reaches as we do in one parih four hundred thouand pounds one eighth part to be of our nation's product uppoes to conume at home to the value of two hundred thouand pounds then aith if the company i may with as great truth and more to the purpoe tell the author whales conume no indian commodities nor are the fih of newfoundland catch' with tea or coffee yet detroyed all their tenants for it is the artians and manufactorers of the kingdom that conume the greatet part of the natural product of the land but for this he hath the ships of the country where they are produced will the dutch then or others conume the wines of spain and leave us none that would not be our los but home of our own manufactories adds nothing to the riches of a nation but if conuming at home twenty shillings aves the expense of forty shillings from abroad then it is the money our product brings from other places and the returns from the indies mot conumed at home he proceeds farther and tells you that whoever looks trictly into our affairs not be able to manage the eat-india trade for that three fourths of them were conumed in england if they had aid nine tenths of the silks they had not been the wear of eat-india commodities but to return to this lat computation of what is conumed at home by the bet calculations i have met with of the eat-india sales not everal computes brought down to an hundred thouand pounds per ann that is o much conumed at home he goes on to prove that by the ret of the indian trade at notions in trade as fih do at fale baits it is true whatever is conumed at home of our own manufactories adds nothing to the riches of a nation but conumption this mut be clear profit to the kingdom becaue that sum would be otherwie conumed in our own product which product we are by this means enabled to export this be ent in money then it is certainly o much los to the nation being conumed at home and i hope our author will allow whatever is conumed at home though the nation being conumed at home and i hope our author will allow whatever is conumed at home though it were of our own product is no gain to the nation were of our own product is no gain to the nation and then what is conumed at the expense of our money

gauzes and in general all sorts of slight silks of which there is a great consumption in germany and all over the north portugal and other places where they prefer these merchants not only of the united provinces but of other countries which causes a prodigious consumption of wood cordage masts sails and other necessaries for shipping of which great numbers are small wares though this kingdom is of vast extent yet there is but very little consumption being neither rich nor well peopled and it may be said that even money would a much greater quantity of goods from the baltic than they bring to it the consumption being very inconsiderable in those parts unless it be at danzig which is the common wines of all sorts french salt and brandies of these liquors there is a great consumption in prussia these commodities are generally truck' for wheat and other corn oak and deal there as if they were things absolutely necessary to support life there is a prodigious consumption of them especially in muscovy and poland the consumption in muscovy is chiefly in nutmegs support life there is a prodigious consumption of them especially in muscovy and poland the consumption in muscovy is chiefly in nutmegs and pepper which they use in their ordinary drink also a very necessary commodity in the north of which there is almost an infinite consumption they have many years since laid aside the making of salt themselves having been used is scarce any sold but in prussia there is likewise in these countries a prodigious consumption of french and spanish wines brandy oil and vinegar paper and dry' fruits of all warm countries produce sell well here in muscovy and poland there is also a vast consumption of cloth and woollen stuffs and silks of the dutch and english manufactury but these ribands iron-ware and small wares from paris stuffs made at rheims and chalons but the consumption of these commodities of the french was very much diminished even before the last war trade with in the greatest and best parts of europe for immense sums and the consumption in america is no less therefore this commodity ought to be considered as one of navigation to caulk and otherwise fortify ships boats and other vessels there is a vast consumption of these in holland they have the greatest quantities from stockholm and wirtzburg but what provisions and merchandise that are convey' to them by these ways as by the great consumption that is made by what is sent back in return the alb takes its source wines which are there bought up for the united provinces where there is a prodigious consumption of them the moselle which runs through all lorraine and the whole electorate of triers to lay new duties on all french goods which would infallibly very much diminish their consumption and consequently be of prejudice to that kingdom the french pretended to be ignorant or look on as the most considerable article of that trade by reason of its vast consumption both in spain and america the french furnish' the spaniards a long time with this is consumed in spain and america especially in peru where their chocolate makes a vast consumption the dutch likewise dispose of in spain a considerable quantity of drugs from the levant the greatest part is sent into the new world and peru alone makes a greater consumption than all mexico 'it must be observ' as a matter of importance that only the a prodigious quantity consum' all over europe in dying scarlet there is no less a consumption of indigo for dying blues the best if i mistake not comes from guatimala the no better in europe so for that very reason there is every year a great consumption of this necessary metal the dutch every year employ in the cadiz trade about thirty as for st ubes where they go for salt there is very little or no consumption the goods they transport to portugal consist chiefly in great quantities of manufactures of silk is there very frequent of all sorts of merchandise except corn there is a vast consumption in portugal and its colonies the goods they bring from portugal are those of the thence to s ubes for their lading of salt of which they make a great consumption in the north where it has been very much in use for a long time river is frequented only by the merchants of africa and turkey there is very little consumption at the two former places which are to be consider' as places of staple for two last in greatest abundance bring into the levant much greater quantities and the vast consumption that there is made is none of the least articles of the english trade the of cordovan turkey leather and common leather is also very considerable there is a vast consumption in italy france and spain and even in the north itself these turkey leathers are dutch trade in the levant the trade for drugs is no less considering the great consumption made in all parts of europe rhubarb and scammony come from tartary and are brought only from the isle of chio nor currants of which the english make a great consumption and are the product of the isles of zante and cephalonia though the dutch were be plucked up the island of ternate is the most considerable there is a great consumption an that place of coarse linen the dutch bring thence tortoise shell which is very so very fruitful that it is sufficient to furnish the whole world considering the little consumption there is of this spice at present the dutch who are entirely masters of all they get cent per cent at least it is very true that there is greater consumption of pepper in the indies than in europe and i have been assured by persons the country and the dutch and portuguese generally buy it there is a far greater consumption of it in asia and especially in persia turkey than in europe it grows in are rough and without any gloss or lustre for which reason there is not much consumption made of them but in the manufactures of holland and hamburgh that of persia which as red or black of which as well as the white there is a great consumption on the coast of melinda and in the emperor of the abyssin's country the philippine to its utmost height which cannot otherwise ever possibly be effected there is a great consumption in this government of coarse linen but the profits arising thereby and other incomes are artois and picardy those that make shimmy leather of bucks goats sheeps and elks skins consume great quantities of this oil which is the most proper for this son of dressing this the most considerable is the wood or timber trade for not only their shipping consume vast quantities but they use besides no less in making tuns pipes barrels and other of other nations that trade thither the spaniards especially those that live in the indies consume prodigious quantities their chief delight being to illuminate their churches sundays and holidays in the dutch who likewise bring all things necessary for shipping salt and corn of which they consume great quantities in those places as well as in other provinces on the sea coast in amboina which island alone is sufficient to produce more than the whole world can consume the people of this island sell every year to the company or their officers their comes from bantam achem very little of this sort comes to us for the mahometans consume almost all of it pepper is a commodity that abounds very much in those parts rock-chrystal coral and lace but especially brandies all the inhabitants of the coast of guinea consume great quantities of linen cloth half worn which they think much more convenient than the one third part of the cinnamon that the dutch have from the east indies is consumed in spain and america especially in peru where their chocolate makes a vast consumption the fleet that came from the indies on the companies account brought quintals which was all consumed in holland in making gun-powder for the republic there is also in the said kingdom by which it appears that this island produces more cloves than can be sold or consumed the whole world over and it is for this reason that it is now thought

 consumption of english wool to populate the nation and raise the value of lands and the show that this bill will not answer the design of it which is a greater consumption of wool but greatly lessen it secondly i shall take notice of the undeniable evil consequences of it and thirdly humbly offer to consideration what are the obstructions to the consumption of wool and a proper means to promote it that this will not answer the of the bill appears thus it is ackowledged by all intelligent persons that the greatest consumption of our english wool is to turkey our merchants transporting thither or clothes yearly which needs be reduced and in time be brought to little or nothing for if the consumption of silk and hair be lessened in england the consumption of english cloth will be or nothing for if the consumption of silk and hair be lessened in england the consumption of english cloth will be proportionably lessen' in turkey and consequenly lessen the consumption of the consumption of english cloth will be proportionably lessen' in turkey and consequenly lessen the consumption of our english wool for it cannot be thought that those persons who now wear for others they wear them already so that there will be no addition to the consumption of wool here in england by virtue of this act besides the prohibiting the wear and because of that little silk in them cannot be worn which will hinder the consumption of wool ten times more than all the cloth worn by virtue of this act act will promote it so that it is manifest this act instead of promoting the consumption of wool will greatly lessen it and in little time bring that staple-commodity and trade parliament will lay aside this act or find some other way for the vending and consumption of our wool and such as may keep at work and employ so many thousand the world before they pass this act which put so great a stop to the consumption of it in turkey the evil consequences of this act follow by this act the england the more cloth made of english wool is vended and this act lessening the consumption of silk must consequently lessen the consumption of their cloth and take off the employment wool is vended and this act lessening the consumption of silk must consequently lessen the consumption of their cloth and take off the employment of many thousands of that trade so will prove a great mistake for besides what hath been already said that the chiefest consumption of our silk and hair stuffs is in the winter-season this also may be added could not in that short time make so many silks as will answer the present consumption of cloth to turkey so that the cloathing-trade must necessarily decline and the manufacturers thereof decline and the manufacturers thereof be exposed to misery for want of employment and the consumption of english wool greatly diminished and the evil influences of this act will not stop give us what laws he pleases which god in mercy prevent the obstructions to the consumption of wool and means to promote it follow the great obstruction to the consumption of the consumption of wool and means to promote it follow the great obstruction to the consumption of wool hath been our wearing great quantities of silks and other commodities from foreign east-india company besides the silks the calicoes last mentioned contribute more to the lessening the consumption of wool than most people are aware of and is little regarded a considerable part and of late many others do wear them for petticoats which hath greatly hindered the consumption of many pretty stuffs some made all of wool and some with a little silk act should pass by that which hath been already said the means of promoting the consumption of wool is near at hand and visible to all if there be an act stuffs which are the product of our own woollen manufactures this would greatly increase the consumption of wool and the former reasons and arguments do sufficiently demonstrate to any impartial considering hair stuffs manufactured here in england are worn and consumed the greater will be the consumption of our english wool and besides these undeniable reasons we appeal to the clothiers themselves doth consume more english wool than numbers of persons that wear cloth therefore if the consumption of wool be a common good to this nation as doubtless it is they are not the wearing of our own silks here and as for for fine cloth the consumption of which sort only will be promoted by this act it hath been more generally the nobility gentry and tradesmen of best quality than in former years and yet the consumption of our english wool hath been little or nothing promoted by it indeed it hath wool hath been little or nothing promoted by it indeed it hath much promoted the consumption of spanish wool which we do not grudge but let it have its course forasmuch an effectual prohibition of all foreign silks that shall be thought prejudicial and hinder the consumption of our own manufactured silks and stuffs without any injunction to wear cloth or stuffs only their silks but stuffs as shaggs prunels barratines tamalets mohairs farendines and others which consume the greatest part of our turkey silk and mohair-yarn are worn chiefly by women in few persons who are employed in making of camlets which at this time doth not consume one tenth part of the mohair-yarn that comes over for the exchange of our cloth with wool which were formerly used in such vestments and which if again used would consume more english wool than can well be imagined i am sure to ten times the truth that he that wears a silk or mohair garment of our own manufacturing doth consume more english wool than numbers of persons that wear cloth therefore if the consumption of thousand people when it is rightly supposed that not one fourth part of the silks consumed in england are manufactured here but in foreign parts will it not be an unspeakable man that the more silk and hair stuffs manufactured here in england are worn and consumed the greater will be the consumption of our english wool and besides these undeniable reasons

consumption computed ch the remain is sufficient to move the government to take the consumption into consideration for my intruding upon politics of government i endeavour to confine my self second head of the causes of irelands not improving in trade is from its excessive consumption of foreign growth and manufactures p why some countries may consume more thanothers with much p why some countries may consume more thanothers with much less damage p the vast consumption of our wealth by foreign silks exceeding twenty to one above our grand-fathers which ruin apparel by sumptuary laws p the spruce garb especially of the meaner sort besides the consumption of our wealth is attended with many other intolerable inconveniences p not only england but the dismal effects of it p bishop hall's sentence p luther's opinion p the great consumption of wealth by our wine-bibbers p by our ale-topers ibid the loss of the labour spent and little gained poverty and decay necessarily follows and this consists in its excessive consumption of foreign commodities first for the belly as wines fruit spice tobacco secondly for the in foreign manufacture for the more full demonstration of the ruining consequence of this excessive consumption of foreign manufactures i shall propose to you this one instance of silks wherein the would amount unto seven thousand five hundred pounds per ann so that by this one consumption of foreign silk-manufacture with its prevention of consuming of our own damnifies this kingdom sixty revive sumptuary laws as may give some restraint to the great extravagances of this national consumption that so threatens the impoverishing of this kingdom is worth the governments consideration and when fifthly this unlimited extravagance of the meaner sort is the chief cause of our intolerable consumption of foreign manufacture for the nobility and gentry are not the twentieth part of the the twentieth part of the number that consume our foreign silks and modes and their consumption would not be felt by the nation if the other were restrained and enjoined to more than all the established revenue but were the third part of their voluntary unnecessary consumption taxed on them by their prince they would groan under it as an unsupportable burden houses with their whole increase but this vice bears hardest on the commonwealth by the consumption of time and money by our peasantly and mechanic gamesters who spend much of their shame and in vain shall we strive to rescue the obstruction of our trade and consumption of our wealth from the desolating influences of these four sorts of debauches until atheism the yearly charge of ireland is per an the total for this period is a consumption great enough to beggar rich england much more poor ireland the end of the first in the stores at each foreign port and what time they will probably take for consumption what kind of vintage or crops is in the countries producing them and by these either to increase the quantity and improve the quality of our natural growth or restrain consumption of foreign goods the first is a work of time and the latter difficult to our native growth and manufactures will not furnish us with foreign commodities sufficientfor our necessary consumption we are better without them if we had fewer silk-shops and taverns it would be is from its excessive consumption of foreign growth and manufactures p why some countries may consume more thanothers with much less damage p the vast consumption of our wealth by foreign put upon gay clothes by the most puissant and wise emperors and princes p we consume more by riot and excess than the kings revenue amounts to p the opinion of is gaming p high gaming amongst the gentry page chiefly peasantly and mechanic gamesters that consume their time and money in bowling-alleys p wealth-wasting debauchery is whoreing p the wealthier sort of other countries for them which is still but the product of their labour they consume nothing of the stock of their country and it is the same with france that manufacture for the nobility and gentry are not the twentieth part of the number that consume our foreign silks and modes and their consumption would not be felt by the nation as effeminates their spirits and unsits them for warlike hardships and actions or whereby they consume and weaken their estates which disables them from contributing those aids the safety of his could demonstrate if his majesty's subjects of this kingdom would but contribute what they vainly consume in rioting and excess it would amount to more than all the established revenue but who besides the ruining of their poor families and thereby filling the country with beggars consume at least one day in a week in this sort of recreation which compute at time breed six or seven drunken sots which fills the country with spendthrifts sometimes they consume their small stocks and run away in debt to several others before their apntices have as tritons or sea-gods burred mel p this vice doth not only obstruct trade and consume the wealth of nations to their great impoverishing but oft times is the cause of world less depends upon foreign supply than ireland for necessaries and it is improvident to consume our selves in superfluities a list of what places return parliament-men in ireland leinster county per ann so that by this one consumption of foreign silk-manufacture with its prevention of consuming of our own damnifies this kingdom sixty seven thousand five hundred pounds per ann obj is a perpetual wooing nothing with labour folly long a doing chap of chargeable wealth consuming and trade-obstructing debaucheries tho this head may be censured as a digression from a discourse destructive to the trade and wealth of this nation both by retarding the increase and consuming its stock which i shall endeavour to demonstrate in these four particulars profane swearing and particular persons and the general discouragement it puts upon traffic and commerce the second wealth consuming debauchery is gaming first high gaming among the gentry though whilst the inhabitants of ireland rich by play as our proverb is what is got over the devils back is consumed on his belly and many and those of no mean rank are known to others that by this one brutish debauchery in its several branches is the wealth of ireland consumed to the value of pounds per annum besides this brutish vice effeminates and debaseth the to four pound per annum each man it amounts to fifty thousand pounds per annum consumed of the growth of the country which might either be exported in beer or corn all and in these and many other cases becomes a great obstructor of trade and consumer of wealth remember this all you that spend

which yet may bring great gain to particular perons it may appear how which they give all encouragement that they may export much and import little to be conumed at home the bulk or greatet part of our foreign trade hath been uually carried carried on to an equality and we take from another nation in goods to be conumed at home to the full value of what they take from us uch trades are us in creature that they ignifie no more than ending to another country to be conumed the overplus we had over and above what was nuclear for our own expense which employment to ome ships yet when perihable commodities are brought in return of it and conumed at home o much of the creature of the nation mut be diminihed as was nations property and concern till remains in uch goods till they are really and actually conumed a trade carried on by the importation of uch commodities which erve only to luxury as advantageous to the nation as any other if uch commodities be again exported and conumed abroad and durable goods brought in the room of them goods purchaed with bullion ent we ent out may likewie afford gains to the nation but if uch goods be conumed at home it will have a quite contrary effect it is not the private gain may get that bring them in and thee through who hands they pas yet if conumed at home home they cannot make any addition to the creature of the nation therefore only of what was ent out but aloe of what was brought in and how conumed if gold and silver or durable commodities deerving the name of creature be brought in as our gold and silver was gotten by foreign trade o it may likewie be conumed by it we ought therefore to ue all means and join all our endeavours that to a much gaiter value than we have exported by which we have not only conumed a great part of the creature we had but all the bullion that hath been produce of uch are not all brought home but ent to ome other country and conumed there and becaue it may be difficult to adjut how many of the goods brought becaue it may be difficult to adjut how many of the goods brought home are conumed here or re-exported or whether the goods exported are ent to the am place for gold and silver was carried off to pay for them and that we have thereby conumed our creature unless we will upon that uch goods brought in tho of no olid will upon that uch goods brought in tho of no olid ue or long ince conumed or perihed do however as well deerve to be eteemed the creature of the nation exports so upon an examination of ome particular trades it will appear that we have conumed our creature the trades that have had the greatet over balance and is well known upon an examination of the state of our coin it will appear that we have conumed a great part of the creature we had in the year and aloe what has which being but half o much as we had we may conclude that we have conumed seven millions of our silver coin ince the year and as it is probable we millions of our silver coin ince the year and as it is probable we have conumed o much of the coin we had so aloe all the silver bullion that has the year that the late war begun is year and added to the seven millions conumed of what we had makes eighteen millions tho it be true that thee eleven millions was brought in by trade yet if it appear that ince the year we have conumed of the coin we had ny great quantity and aloe the whole of what has our goods and products at leat per an it hold be granted that we have conumed by our bad trades what we have got by our good unless thoe that are increae of gold coin can make amends for the great quantity of our silver coin conumed nor any mall increae of plate or jewels the improvement of our lands and encreae etimated they would probably appear o inconiderable compared with the bullion and coin we have conumed as that they would not deerve the title of an article in computations of our good marks and igns that we had ships and people and that we had not conumed all our creature before the war but uch marks and igns of strength and power strength and power ought not to be taken as a proof that we had not conumed part of our creature before the war by foreign traffic or that we might not tored with more coin to have circulated for the payment of the charge whether we conumed more bullion by the war than was in thoe years brought in by trade or war than was in thoe years brought in by trade or whether we hold have conumed by thoe trades which have uually carried out coin and were interrupted by the war were interrupted by the war more bullion if they had not been interrupted than was conumed by the war may ooner be deputed than decided therefore if it appear that we long as our exportations were confined to uch we were ecure againt having our creature conumed by trade and had it in our power to make additions by good husbandry in money be ufficient for the government and commerce and in what time it may be conumed if great encouragement be given to exportation by a prodigal conumption of foreign commodities at produce p nothing can be a clearer gain to this kingdom than the return of conumed at home becaue treble that um would otherwie be carried out for foreign silks and be about per ann of which the returns might be about whereof there might be conumed at home to the value of when it comes into the econd third and fourth collected from thoe particulars to anwer or make amends for the coin and bullion we conumed in thoe years and if not then it mut be concluded that we have decreed goods are perihable and that many of them as well as our other products were conumed at home and that therefore they ought not to be computed as an addition of reckon' as an addition to our wealth and the other three quarters allowed to be conumed but then it is expected that the am arguments hall be admitted as to perihable will appear to be inconiderable in value compared with thoe species therefore if we have conumed our gold and silver it will jutifie the aertion that has occaioned much of this to the nation if it had been kept here will by uch a trade be conumed and what brought in be in the dreyns or on the dunghill in a horrid ground for an inquiry to find out what bullion had been imported and exported or conumed at home if they had been altogether fictitious yet being offered only in order to the importation of bullion at per an for years as there mentioned what will remain conumed of our old stock is nine millions which it may be feared does not differ materials are old the manufacturers work and the merchants adventure if uch tobacco be not conumed at home but re-exported unless gold and silver or ome durable commodities be brought in by sales abroad or out of our own people by high prizes on uch goods conumed at home and whether the ending out of o much bullion annually to purchae uch the took of the nation by any part of the aid twelve millions that is conumed at home but only by uch part as is converted into what is lating and we did uually end out to india which others compute to be and that we conumed much bullion for wrought plate fringe lace and being it is uppoed he will own thoe years and in thee species that was laid up in the nation and not conumed amounts to per annum but if the author will not go o far back but for gold being coined over and over for hammer' money melted down for milled money conumed or exported which increae of our coin in thoe years is near about the am brought into the nation in thoe years or in the years by trade and not conumed but either laid up in commodities in specie or converted into money or ome uch no manner of means be undertood to get o much by what woollen goods are conumed in the nations as by what is carried to foreign markets it is not doubted been all along owned that we make no addition to our riches by what is conumed at home but it does not therefore follow that we mut end out our money or if not that he would tell us not only how our wool hall be conumed but how the poor who daily increae upon us hall be employed if all the eel impoverih a nation and how the creature of the kingdom may be wated and conumed by trades which yet may bring great gain to particular perons it may appear how which they give all encouragement that they may export much and import little to be conumed at home the bulk or greatet part of our foreign trade hath been uually carried carried on to an equality and we take from another nation in goods to be conumed at home to the full value of what they take from us uch trades are us in creature that they ignifie no more than ending to another country to be conumed the overplus we had over and above what was nuclear for our own expense which employment to ome ships yet when perihable commodities are brought in return of it and conumed at home o much of the creature of the nation mut be diminihed as was nations property and concern till remains in uch goods till they are really and actually conumed a trade carried on by the importation of uch commodities which erve only to luxury as advantageous to the nation as any other if uch commodities be again exported and conumed abroad and durable goods brought in the room of them goods purchaed with bullion ent we ent out may likewie afford gains to the nation but if uch goods be conumed at home it will have a quite contrary effect it is not the private gain may get that bring them in and thee through who hands they pas yet if conumed at home home they cannot make any addition to the creature of the nation therefore only of what was ent out but aloe of what was brought in and how conumed if gold and silver or durable commodities deerving the name of creature be brought in as our gold and silver was gotten by foreign trade o it may likewie be conumed by it we ought therefore to ue all means and join all our endeavours that to a much gaiter value than we have exported by which we have not only conumed a great part of the creature we had but all the bullion that hath been produce of uch are not all brought home but ent to ome other country and conumed there and becaue it may be difficult to adjut how many of the goods brought becaue it may be difficult to adjut how many of the goods brought home are conumed here or re-exported or whether the goods exported are ent to the am place for gold and silver was carried off to pay for them and that we have thereby conumed our creature unless we will upon that uch goods brought in tho of no olid will upon that uch goods brought in tho of no olid ue or long ince conumed or perihed do however as well deerve to be eteemed the creature of the nation exports so upon an examination of ome particular trades it will appear that we have conumed our creature the trades that have had the greatet over balance and is well known upon an examination of the state of our coin it will appear that we have conumed a great part of the creature we had in the year and aloe what has which being but half o much as we had we may conclude that we have conumed seven millions of our silver coin ince the year and as it is probable we millions of our silver coin ince the year and as it is probable we have conumed o much of the coin we had so aloe all the silver bullion that has the year that the late war begun is year and added to the seven millions conumed of what we had makes eighteen millions tho it be true that thee eleven millions was brought in by trade yet if it appear that ince the year we have conumed of the coin we had ny great quantity and aloe the whole of what has our goods and products at leat per an it hold be granted that we have conumed by our bad trades what we have got by our good unless thoe that are increae of gold coin can make amends for the great quantity of our silver coin conumed nor any mall increae of plate or jewels the improvement of our lands and encreae etimated they would probably appear o inconiderable compared with the bullion and coin we have conumed as that they would not deerve the title of an article in computations of our good marks and igns that we had ships and people and that we had not conumed all our creature before the war but uch marks and igns of strength and power strength and power ought not to be taken as a proof that we had not conumed part of our creature before the war by foreign traffic or that we might not tored with more coin to have circulated for the payment of the charge whether we conumed more bullion by the war than was in thoe years brought in by trade or war than was in thoe years brought in by trade or whether we hold have conumed by thoe trades which have uually carried out coin and were interrupted by the war were interrupted by the war more bullion if they had not been interrupted than was conumed by the war may ooner be deputed than decided therefore if it appear that we long as our exportations were confined to uch we were ecure againt having our creature conumed by trade and had it in our power to make additions by good husbandry in money be ufficient for the government and commerce and in what time it may be conumed if great encouragement be given to exportation by a prodigal conumption of foreign commodities at produce p nothing can be a clearer gain to this kingdom than the return of conumed at home becaue treble that um would otherwie be carried out for foreign silks and be about per ann of which the returns might be about whereof there might be conumed at home to the value of when it comes into the econd third and fourth collected from thoe particulars to anwer or make amends for the coin and bullion we conumed in thoe years and if not then it mut be concluded that we have decreed goods are perihable and that many of them as well as our other products were conumed at home and that therefore they ought not to be computed as an addition of reckon' as an addition to our wealth and the other three quarters allowed to be conumed but then it is expected that the am arguments hall be admitted as to perihable will appear to be inconiderable in value compared with thoe species therefore if we have conumed our gold and silver it will jutifie the aertion that has occaioned much of this to the nation if it had been kept here will by uch a trade be conumed and what brought in be in the dreyns or on the dunghill in a horrid ground for an inquiry to find out what bullion had been imported and exported or conumed at home if they had been altogether fictitious yet being offered only in order to the importation of bullion at per an for years as there mentioned what will remain conumed of our old stock is nine millions which it may be feared does not differ materials are old the manufacturers work and the merchants adventure if uch tobacco be not conumed at home but re-exported unless gold and silver or ome durable commodities be brought in by sales abroad or out of our own people by high prizes on uch goods conumed at home and whether the ending out of o much bullion annually to purchae uch the took of the nation by any part of the aid twelve millions that is conumed at home but only by uch part as is converted into what is lating and we did uually end out to india which others compute to be and that we conumed much bullion for wrought plate fringe lace and being it is uppoed he will own thoe years and in thee species that was laid up in the nation and not conumed amounts to per annum but if the author will not go o far back but for gold being coined over and over for hammer' money melted down for milled money conumed or exported which increae of our coin in thoe years is near about the am brought into the nation in thoe years or in the years by trade and not conumed but either laid up in commodities in specie or converted into money or ome uch no manner of means be undertood to get o much by what woollen goods are conumed in the nations as by what is carried to foreign markets it is not doubted been all along owned that we make no addition to our riches by what is conumed at home but it does not therefore follow that we mut end out our money or if not that he would tell us not only how our wool hall be

here from our plantations because of the advantages we have by the exportation in the consumption of our product and employment of the poor but no trade is more likely to is more our interest to apply our selves to increase our products and manufactories and consumption of them and to retrieve our fishing trade to add to our stock then to great influence upon the increase or decrease of riches those that are prodigal in the consumption of foreign commodities do by that prodigality bring the nation in debt more than necessary for the manufacturing of all goods to be made fit for exportation and for the consumption of what brought from abroad may be esteemed as part of our domestic trade so in the manufacturing of such commodities and if people increase we should have a greater consumption but because it is the surest way to lay a foundation for the increasing of and as the goodness of commodities is absolutely necessary to introduce encourage or preserve the consumption of them so is the price few persons either abroad or at home are so hinderance to our seamen and navigation to our own merchants and factors and to the consumption of our own manufactures by such importations as may be made unless settled with such to all others hath occasioned many complaints that it is a great hinderance to the consumption of our woolen goods but whether the complaints arise from the interest of foreigners who east-india trade employs many ships and some very good but that it is rather a consumption than nursery of seamen carrying away generally only the choicest and sometimes burying half of of our own manufactures and products that the cotton yarn and cotton wool hinders the consumption of those commodities from our plantations then the only question will be whither we had out as well as some others already mentioned if a stop be put to the consumption here of goods manufactured in the east-indies then the woollen goods that company are now of materials and day labourers which being extraordinary cheap in those parts must if the consumption be encouraged prove a hinderance to the consumption if not end in the destruction of cheap in those parts must if the consumption be encouraged prove a hinderance to the consumption if not end in the destruction of a great quantity of the manufactures of england to the nation in general if the exportation of our coin without limitation and the consumption of their manufactured goods from india should be permitted therefore it is as unlikely that trade they drive in spices and other commodities in those parts and the expense and consumption of the manufactured goods not encouraged amongst themselves it being affirmed that they enjoin their less should then be employed in that trade the advantages we shall have in the consumption of our home-made silks and woollen goods and in the increase of our linen manufactury that trade and the trade to africa under such regulations most likely to increase the consumption of our goods in those parts the more hath been said about these trades because off and none paid for the future would occasion the increase of the export and consumption of them for though the duty be not great yet being an addition to the great discouragement to exportation and that addition to the cost is some hinderance to the consumption abroad the act of navigation though a very good act in the mainacts of navigation promote and secure such trade that it may continue and increase but if our importations consumption at home and the exportation of coin or bullion be left at liberty we may pernicious trades otherwise some trades will prove to the body politic as a canker or consumption to the body natural if the state of our trade in woollen goodsthe declining state way to keep and retain riches when got must be by good husbandry in the consumption and expense of the goods of foreign nations and in all our dealings with them be found the best and surest way to preserve and retain them the expense and consumption of such commodities as have and are always like to be purchased with our money or have the more to transport to foreign markets all prodigality at home in the consumption of commodities that are fit for foreign markets is in effect a consuming of so they would soon find as their ancestors did to be their true interest though the consumption of costly foreign commodities hath too much also advanced the annual expenses of the trading so much to their prejudice and impoverishing of the nation without their help in the consumption of such commodities as we have good provisions for the supply of nature so good bullion or any great advantage thereby being some have hinder' the exportation as well as consumption of our own fabrics and others have always been exchanged for other commodities abroad to denied that the great quantities of manufactured goods brought here from india do hinder the consumption of the like quantity of the manufactured goods of europe so it may be made be made out that we have the greatest share by the loss occasioned by the consumption of such goods if we will continue sending out our wool to be manufactured abroad no immediate influence upon the enriching or impoverishing of the nation but those nations which consume most of the products of foreign countries and also are extravagant in the expense of to be carried on if no other remedy those trades may be esteemed good which consume our productswhat trades good and manufactures upon which the value of our land and employment as london the many discoveries that have been made of countries and trades which now consume great quantities of our products were always by bold adventurers the incorporating of trades in what a condition we shall be if by our own folly and extravagances we should consume what we have now left and occasion a perpetual scarcity of it or at least as a gentleman that hath but per annum and yet spends per annum is of consuming his estate and that unless we can by altering our course of living put a can be so changed as to cooperate therewith not using proper methods to get or consuming riches as soon as got will render all endeavours of that kind ineffectual as idleness in the consumption of commodities that are fit for foreign markets is in effect a consuming of so much of the treasure of the nation because would yield and produce treasure most vendible which is more then can be said for the landed men's buying and consuming any sort of goods that were contrary to their own and the public interest therefore by the exportation of bullion can bring us in any returns but what must be consumed in luxury or prodigality or hinder the expense of our own manufactures we should make countries to which we did use to send them should continue in esteem and be consumed here then we shall either send out our bullion to purchase them or those that supply them there must be a danger that the riches of the nation must be consumed and that scarcity and poverty will ensue it is not doubtedto prevent idleness but there enemies by sea is material without it foreign trade cannot be advantageous by the goods consumed or spent at home our necessities for them are supplied what are not so spent of gold and silver lace wire fringe or for gilding and such like uses hath consumed per annum and that the northern trades have ever since the fire of london carried much of that happily went to supply the want of plate in families which was consumed by the civil war yet a great quantity was then also exported which is a mbrelloes vvax candles of which one half in value are usually transported and the rest consumed here being the giving a full account of the original progress management causes of the east-indies and the toys and knickknacks before this war being in great esteem and generally consumed it hath been computed that per annum was usually laid out here at home for exportation of as many of our goods to africa as can by any means be consumed there and it is not likely that companies will make bold adventures to open new self by the exportation of too much bullion and importation of manufactured goods to be consumed here the prohibiting the expense of their manufactured goods and toys here would very much to china for the expense of our cloths where great quantities if introduced would be consumed and gold is plenty or from gambroon to persia being the carriage of our goods it be found that we have walked in indirect paths and thereby or by misfortune consumed or lost much of our treasure stock and trade and brought our selves into a nation because would yield and produce treasure more or less if it were not so consumed from which it may be concluded that as nothing is more dangerous to reduce a but not engaged in trade give their help also either by affording materials or as consumers of what made here or brought from abroad the

the said goods are consumed at home and that those manufactured goods do hinder the consumption of what are fabrickt by our own people the landed men have now reason to may be examined because the rents of land as well as preservation of our coin consumption of our manufactures and the employment of our people doth much depend upon what resolutions in our favour nor till we apply our selves more to good husbandry in the consumption of foreign commodities can well be expected ever will that no rational account can be and taffaties though it be not doubted but the silks from india do hinder the consumption of some damasks taffaties and sarsenets yet being those were all or most purchased by known in england till within these years also for aprons and thus do hinder the consumption of cambrics and lawns and the course calicoes of some course clothes but if cambrics handicraft and manufactured goods which we least want not only to the hindrance of the consumption of our wool but the employment of our people from whence only riches can have silk and silk weavers labour proportionable the india goods will occasion a stop to the consumption of them because those from india must otherwise be cheapest and all people will go treasure of a nation that we have not increased in riches since anno that the consumption of east-india silks and linens at home do us no service by hindering the expense for our advantange but the cheapest if we should reject our own and prefer the consumption of those from india amongst us we may reasonably expect that other nations should by is more probable then that the expense of our woollen manufactures will increase if the consumption of those goods from india be continued but least these and such like arguments given bring india goods into europe the dutch would and thereby hurt abroad the vent and consumption of our english cloth but this needs no answer here it being not proposed that that the english shall be prohibited from bringing these goods into europe but only the consumption of them in england and the consumption of our english cloth were never understood to bringing these goods into europe but only the consumption of them in england and the consumption of our english cloth were never understood to be much prejudiced by these goods this such manufactures at home and those trades abroad rather then put any stop to the consumption of these beloved goods from india as the author hath sufficiently by such arguments discovered from the india be so advantageous and that selling cheap is the way to increase consumption why hath he not proposed the opening of that trade that it may not be drive the greatest trades of all european nations and that doth depend much upon the consumption of their own manufactures if these indian silks be consumed as is owned page the in this treatise and that have found their end by it for by encouraging the consumption of their own manufactures both at home and abroad and their fishing trades have increased money then to use all endeavours to preserve and increase it by frugality in the consumption of foreign commodities and labour and industry for the increasing and promoting the consumption of the consumption of foreign commodities and labour and industry for the increasing and promoting the consumption of our own so long as the nation keeps to frugality and industry laws may nation keeps to frugality and industry laws may not be absolutely necessary to limit the consumption of any foreign commodities nor to increase or promote our own manufactures but if there such trades and therefore if no laws must be made to promote the making or consumption of our own goods nor to hinder the importation or consumption of any from abroad promote the making or consumption of our own goods nor to hinder the importation or consumption of any from abroad it must inevitably follow that when ever a nation falls into no money left to carry on such trades unless the government interfere to hinder the consumption of such commodities as upon an exact inquiry may be found do carry out our their posterities and common good as well as to their present gain for as the consumption of some commodities may be hinder' thereby so will make room for their trading in will much depend upon good sales to our commodities abroad and good husbandry in the consumption of foreign commodities at home but the having of many sorts of manufactures of our poor beaten out of their employment sufficient care being taken by prohibiting or discouraging the consumption of such goods as occasion the carrying out of our coin or bullion and for or which way a nation can get by trade as long as by a prodigal consumption of foreign commodities and neglecting and discouraging of our own we take in more than brought hither because are subject to corruption and in a short course of years will consume to nothing and then of no value this being stated if agreed whoever will undertake us to what price he would have wool fall and in what places we can consume more woollen goods abroad many landed men have for many years past found wool already like arguments given in that treatise to persuade us that it is our interest to consume these goods at home should not be sufficient at last the old bugbears the dutch do or might make by the other branches of that trade for other nations that consume such goods because have none of their own fabric cannot be at any loss in either by prohibitions or rather by example or high impositions laid upon the vending and consuming of them at home which happily may be found most in offensive as to foreign denied being now owned by this treatise that one half of the said goods are consumed at home and that those manufactured goods do hinder the consumption of what are fabrickt annually hath been lost by that trade for what comes back in goods to be consumed here makes us no amends for the treasure exported and trades that cannot be balanced and how and for what uses those silks and linens and these from india are consumed that will make it plainly appear that these goods from india do us no such linens from india the muzlings and fine linens from india it may be observ' are consumed for long cravats nightrails commodes and window curtains an expense not known in england till the india trade at the same time may make of pa that our woollen goods consumed at home do not enrich the nation and that a high price on our woollen being an undoubted truth the arguments in favour of east-india goods that they should be consumed either at home or abroad in the room of them are the more to be doth depend much upon the consumption of their own manufactures if these indian silks be consumed as is owned page the st in the room of our stuffs anthorines and the what hath been said it may appear that the manufactured goods from india spent and consumed in england cannot by any way be instrumental to prevent the going out of our to put a stop to it that the treasure of the nation may not be consumed thereby for by the course of trade no stop can happen to any such consumptions is absolutely necessary to carry on trade as well as for our defence will be consumed by which the traders themselves as well as the generality will in time be involved and all be spent at home we may soon find the treasure of the nation consumed our stock of gold and silver which we had for the carrying on of trade a recompense for the loss the nation will receive by having their stock of money consumed and the poor beaten out of their employment sufficient care being taken by prohibiting or sales of such goods to the gentlemen and landed men or others who are the consumers but not concerned in the stock by making them give great rates for what they

here from our plantations because of the advantages we have by the exportation in the consumption of our product and employment of the poor but no trade is more likely to is more our interest to apply our selves to increase our products and manufactories and consumption of them and to retrieve our fishing trade to add to our stock then to great influence upon the increase or decrease of riches those that are prodigal in the consumption of foreign commodities do by that prodigality bring the nation in debt more than necessary for the manufacturing of all goods to be made fit for exportation and for the consumption of what brought from abroad may be esteemed as part of our domestic trade so in the manufacturing of such commodities and if people increase we should have a greater consumption but because it is the surest way to lay a foundation for the increasing of and as the goodness of commodities is absolutely necessary to introduce encourage or preserve the consumption of them so is the price few persons either abroad or at home are so hinderance to our seamen and navigation to our own merchants and factors and to the consumption of our own manufactures by such importations as may be made unless settled with such to all others hath occasioned many complaints that it is a great hinderance to the consumption of our woolen goods but whether the complaints arise from the interest of foreigners who east-india trade employs many ships and some very good but that it is rather a consumption than nursery of seamen carrying away generally only the choicest and sometimes burying half of of our own manufactures and products that the cotton yarn and cotton wool hinders the consumption of those commodities from our plantations then the only question will be whither we had out as well as some others already mentioned if a stop be put to the consumption here of goods manufactured in the east-indies then the woollen goods that company are now of materials and day labourers which being extraordinary cheap in those parts must if the consumption be encouraged prove a hinderance to the consumption if not end in the destruction of cheap in those parts must if the consumption be encouraged prove a hinderance to the consumption if not end in the destruction of a great quantity of the manufactures of england to the nation in general if the exportation of our coin without limitation and the consumption of their manufactured goods from india should be permitted therefore it is as unlikely that trade they drive in spices and other commodities in those parts and the expense and consumption of the manufactured goods not encouraged amongst themselves it being affirmed that they enjoin their less should then be employed in that trade the advantages we shall have in the consumption of our home-made silks and woollen goods and in the increase of our linen manufactury that trade and the trade to africa under such regulations most likely to increase the consumption of our goods in those parts the more hath been said about these trades because off and none paid for the future would occasion the increase of the export and consumption of them for though the duty be not great yet being an addition to the great discouragement to exportation and that addition to the cost is some hinderance to the consumption abroad the act of navigation though a very good act in the mainacts of navigation promote and secure such trade that it may continue and increase but if our importations consumption at home and the exportation of coin or bullion be left at liberty we may pernicious trades otherwise some trades will prove to the body politic as a canker or consumption to the body natural if the state of our trade in woollen goodsthe declining state way to keep and retain riches when got must be by good husbandry in the consumption and expense of the goods of foreign nations and in all our dealings with them be found the best and surest way to preserve and retain them the expense and consumption of such commodities as have and are always like to be purchased with our money or have the more to transport to foreign markets all prodigality at home in the consumption of commodities that are fit for foreign markets is in effect a consuming of so they would soon find as their ancestors did to be their true interest though the consumption of costly foreign commodities hath too much also advanced the annual expenses of the trading so much to their prejudice and impoverishing of the nation without their help in the consumption of such commodities as we have good provisions for the supply of nature so good bullion or any great advantage thereby being some have hinder' the exportation as well as consumption of our own fabrics and others have always been exchanged for other commodities abroad to denied that the great quantities of manufactured goods brought here from india do hinder the consumption of the like quantity of the manufactured goods of europe so it may be made be made out that we have the greatest share by the loss occasioned by the consumption of such goods if we will continue sending out our wool to be manufactured abroad no immediate influence upon the enriching or impoverishing of the nation but those nations which consume most of the products of foreign countries and also are extravagant in the expense of to be carried on if no other remedy those trades may be esteemed good which consume our productswhat trades good and manufactures upon which the value of our land and employment as london the many discoveries that have been made of countries and trades which now consume great quantities of our products were always by bold adventurers the incorporating of trades in what a condition we shall be if by our own folly and extravagances we should consume what we have now left and occasion a perpetual scarcity of it or at least as a gentleman that hath but per annum and yet spends per annum is of consuming his estate and that unless we can by altering our course of living put a can be so changed as to cooperate therewith not using proper methods to get or consuming riches as soon as got will render all endeavours of that kind ineffectual as idleness in the consumption of commodities that are fit for foreign markets is in effect a consuming of so much of the treasure of the nation because would yield and produce treasure most vendible which is more then can be said for the landed men's buying and consuming any sort of goods that were contrary to their own and the public interest therefore by the exportation of bullion can bring us in any returns but what must be consumed in luxury or prodigality or hinder the expense of our own manufactures we should make countries to which we did use to send them should continue in esteem and be consumed here then we shall either send out our bullion to purchase them or those that supply them there must be a danger that the riches of the nation must be consumed and that scarcity and poverty will ensue it is not doubtedto prevent idleness but there enemies by sea is material without it foreign trade cannot be advantageous by the goods consumed or spent at home our necessities for them are supplied what are not so spent of gold and silver lace wire fringe or for gilding and such like uses hath consumed per annum and that the northern trades have ever since the fire of london carried much of that happily went to supply the want of plate in families which was consumed by the civil war yet a great quantity was then also exported which is a mbrelloes vvax candles of which one half in value are usually transported and the rest consumed here being the giving a full account of the original progress management causes of the east-indies and the toys and knickknacks before this war being in great esteem and generally consumed it hath been computed that per annum was usually laid out here at home for exportation of as many of our goods to africa as can by any means be consumed there and it is not likely that companies will make bold adventures to open new self by the exportation of too much bullion and importation of manufactured goods to be consumed here the prohibiting the expense of their manufactured goods and toys here would very much to china for the expense of our cloths where great quantities if introduced would be consumed and gold is plenty or from gambroon to persia being the carriage of our goods it be found that we have walked in indirect paths and thereby or by misfortune consumed or lost much of our treasure stock and trade and brought our selves into a nation because would yield and produce treasure more or less if it were not so consumed from which it may be concluded that as nothing is more dangerous to reduce a but not engaged in trade give their help also either by affording materials or as consumers of what made here or brought from abroad the merchants by exporting and importing the admit of strict execution and are always looked upon as vexatious by the tradesmen and consumers both if relate to foreign commodities then the nations concerned in those commodities may take

no estimates can be made whether a nation get or lose by any trade unless consumption be consider' as a part of trade p that we shall not get treasure by of them for the getting of money but to rectify mistakes that may occasion the consumption of the coin we have and make such paper credit useless or to force us reject and despise such and have no regard for them and approve of a lavish consumption it is apparent to every one that we are not in danger at present to treasure of the nation could be expected to be gotten from foreigners by them the consumption of such of our products as we cannot spend at home the procuring from foreign do observe a more infallible method to secure their treasure by good husbandry in the consumption of foreign commodities at home sending to other countries what they import from abroad as afford great advantages and give a great encouragement to all sorts of improvements by this consumption abroad added to our consumption at home for the landed men have thereby opportunities to a great encouragement to all sorts of improvements by this consumption abroad added to our consumption at home for the landed men have thereby opportunities to sell more of their products the goods brought in our exportations of more profitable goods have been lessened and the consumption of our manufactures at home diminished the gaining of gold and silver being that which can be made of any foreign trade with respect to the nation in general unless consumption in which all trade in commodities must terminate be considered as a part of trade whether they have got or lost till they have sold their goods which is as consumption to them so no exact account can be made whether a nation get or lose can be made whether a nation get or lose by any trade without taking in consumption whereby it may be known how the said goods are finally disposed off every sale finally disposed off every sale is an alteration of property and as such is a consumption to the several buyers and sellers but the nations property and concern still remains in or durable commodities sent out then the nation must lose which cannot be known unless consumption be consider' as a part of trade that the perishable commodities may be distinguished from or whether the nation have got or lost by any particular trade without tracing the consumption of the goods brought in so far as the last vender is ont only contrary contrary to the meaning of the word as it refers to the nation whether the consumption of goods in the hands of the last vender be in strictness of words a be used to establish and improve the manufacturing of goods at home and promote their consumption and that foreign trade should be carried on by the exportation of our products or and preserved prohibiting for that purpose the exportation of it and discouraging the importation and consumption of unnecessary foreign commodities that they might export in goods to a greater value than which have carried out our coin or bulion to purchase goods and by promoting the consumption of foreign commodities at home have altered the balance and occasioned the importation of goods pains to deceive others and on the contrary it being notorious that the importation and consumption of foreign commodities and the exportation of bullion hath much increased upon us since that or other goods to our own products exported and all the pretended advantages by the consumption of such goods at home it will appear that we have been under an impossibility considered that the goods brought in from denmark swedeland and france are for our own consumption and that very few of them were ever re-exported and that the general expense of our gold and silver for goods and must have the same effect as to the consumption of our gold and silver according to the quantity of bullion sent out as any by the importation of foreign commodities purchased with our coin or bullion and being the consumption of these foreign commodities by all ranks and degrees have occasioned that our importations have trades hereafter instead of disputing how it is gone considerations how to prevent a further consumption and to recover what we have lost will be most useful after a little more trade and had it in our power to make additions by good husbandry in the consumption of foreign commodities but as all exportations of coin or bullion for trade must be immediately in trade if a want of coin should ensue as there is a constant consumption of gold and silver at home by wearing and losing for gilding of fringes laces time it may be consumed if great encouragement be given to exportation by a prodigal consumption of foreign commodities at home the increase and decrease of our coin and bullion entirely design of those tracts was to excite us to industry and good husbandry in the consumption of foreign commodities that we might keep and increase our coin in order to grow the said per ann is clear gains by that trade bought at sales for foreign consumption per ann the returns whereof may add to the european ball per ann saved by nature in the room of which east-india goods are used per ann saved in the consumption of our home materials which these goods supply and whereby our exportation is enlarged per trade for tho the victualing of ships for foreign trade gives a help to the consumption of our provisions yet neither the cattle nor the lands on which they feed nor are coined gold coined silver bullion wrought plate rings jewels furniture apparel stock for trade consumption and live stock in cattle and for fear he should have forgotten to have enumerated that might be esteemed wealth stock or riches four boundless are added and the word consumption is crowd ed in as a matter or thing that might be accounted wealth it the help that foreign trade has afforded towards advancing the value of lands by the consumption it has given to great quantities of our products abroad and by gold and silver the public charge of the government by duties and to the landed men by the consumption of their wool which being over and above what we wanted for our own use india into two parts viz half for foreign exportation and the other half for home consumption the returns of in time of peace may probably yield at abroad the returns of produce and particularly for their share in the supposed to be gain' by our own consumption in time of peace by this traffic there came in to the king for his trade p that bengalls and stained calicoes and other east india goods do hinder the consumption of norwich-stuffs crapes english ratteens shalloons says perpetuanos and antherines which are sorts of goods these goods from india may be convenient to be allowed yet that by the general consumption of them we have wounded our selves at the heart by hindering the consumption of general consumption of them we have wounded our selves at the heart by hindering the consumption of our wool and the employment of our people not only on the woollen manufacture should bear a high price in our markets at home secondly that by a great consumption of the wool on manufactures in this kingdom the public will not reap such an may be brought down as a good method to make way for the exportation and consumption of more of our woollen goods abroad it was an over-sight in the author not prevent the importation of all european manufactured goods that could be imagined would hinder the consumption of our own being still in force and those against the exportation of bullion were out to purchase such goods should be brought into the nation again by the immediate consumption of such goods here so the low price to which the author would have ours showed what woollen goods we sent out that were saved here at home by the consumption of those from india to what places they were sent and what gold and silver thither and that the importation of such great quantities of manufactured goods that hinder the consumption of our own both abroad and at home with the many handicraft wares that lessen opinion that the enlarging of the trade by such methods would diminishour coin hinder the consumption of our own manufactures and endanger a dissolution of the company by the clamours they it when we have no such prospect but being the author suggests p that the consumption of our woollen goods may be promoted in tartary japan china and many other places grow poor that spends more than his income so a nation that by a lavish consumption of foreign commodities at home occasion the importation of goods from abroad that exceed in is most likely to afford us the advantages expected by frugality is the promoting the consumption of our own products and manufactures for as the using of such at home would be retained in the nation which cannot be expected as long as by the prodigal consumption at home of perishable commodities the traders may reap more profit by importing them than from what places bullion did formerly come in or may hereafter to satisfy any such consumption and demand or such a consumption as he may guess our trades as now carried come in or may hereafter to satisfy any such consumption and demand or such a consumption as he may guess our trades as now carried on may require least by endeavouring so they would not be brought in but in expectation of a sudden sale and consumption those for eatting and drinking are soon reduced to nothing and those for apparel have stock of such goods in the nation but what lie for want of sale or consumption or to supply the markets though it be not doubted but that in most of amounted to a considerable sum yet it appears by this account that such was the consumption of our bullion before it came to the mint or soon after that ann there is supposed he means those that are very course that they may not hinder the consumption of india goods then adds that it is undoubtedly true that a rise in its the nation than a rise of three pence per pound occasion' only by our own consumption though the truth of this assertion shall not be disputed at present yet it ought by particular persons in procuring of wealth for themselves which may tend to diminish and consume what may most properly be called the treasure of the nation the acquisitions or riches it by such trade may induce us to allow and encourage those trades that will consume the treasure we have or may divert us from taking right methods to gain more the government will be well applied to improve and encourage all trades that do not consume our treasure tho no addition to the treasure of the nation could be expected to fish working in mines or otherwise are hereby enabled to live and to purchase and consume the products of the earth which is also a further advantage to the landed men a wide step for some trades may bring gain to particular persons which yet may consume and be destructive of the treasure of the nation no true estimate can be made and means that particular persons have to get riches for their own use and to consume the treasure of the nation may be many yet the ways that we can put the war may sooner be disputed than decided therefore if it appear that we did consume our coin or bullion by trade before the late war and there be a danger most probable that could be invented to make us act the part of prodigals and consume our treasure by spending more than our income being one of the ends designed by of trade in general the gain is so much only as the nation doth not consume of the imports but either lays up in commodities in specie or converts into money fear that the door should be shut to hinder its exportation that we may not consume the rest that is left for which finding himself at a loss for good arguments norwich-stuffs crapes english ratteens shalloons says perpetuanos and antherines which are sorts of goods that consume a great deal of our wool and employ great numbers of our people it may are now and by that means we should export more yet if we must not consume any of them at home which this author takes to be inconvenient but send them fix any true bounds or limits because there are many reasons why some persons should consume and spend more than others not only in value but of some sort of goods of trade in general the gain is so much only as the nation did not consume of the imports but either lays up in commodities in specie or converts into money he mentions so it may confirm what has been said that though we may easily consume our coin yet that it will not be regained without a great deal of difficulty mislead to neglect our concerns at home and run into errors that may occasion the consuming of what we have on a supposition that it is easy to get riches from of the nation and to the procuring for us what we want from abroad without consuming our coin which would lie dead and be of little benefit to us nor the of affording any argments that we are rich they demonstrate that we have gone on consuming the riches we had that we have a stock of iron lead tin and of alterations in the course of trade we shall not replenish our stores but go on consuming not only the stock we have but all the bullion that can be expected to luxury than others yet that liberty should not be extended to what may endanger the consuming of the treasure or public stock of the body politic a mischief that might be coin that we have decreased our treasure since ann p that we have not only consumed much of the old silver coin we had before but also all the silver bullion great fleets or maintained great armies not allowed as a proof that we had not consumed much of our treasure by trade before the war p a fundamental position laid down render it more beneficial ought to be encouraged least the treasure of the nation be consumed whilst we are disputing which is the way to preserve and increase it erroneous positions the nation between such commodities that are only useful to supply its necessity or else consumed as soon as procured or only valuable among our selves and those goods and commodities else impoverish a nation and how the treasure of the kingdom may be wasted and consumed by trades which yet may bring great gain to particular persons it may appear how which they give all encouragement that they may export much and import little to be consumed at home the bulk or greatest part of our foreign trade hath been usually carried carried on to an equality and we take from another nation in goods to be consumed at home to the full value of what they take from us such trades are us in treasure that they signify no more than sending to another country to be consumed the overplus we had over and above what was neceslary for our own expense which employment to some ships yet when perishable commodities are brought in return of it and consumed at home so much of the treasure of the nation must be diminished as was nations property and concern still remains in such goods till they are really and actually consumed a trade carried on by the importation of such commodities which serve only to luxury as advantageous to the nation as any other if such commodities be again exported and consumed abroad and durable goods brought in the room of them goods purchased with bullion sent we sent out may likewise afford gains to the nation but if such goods be consumed at home it will have a quite contrary effect it is not the private gain may get that bring them in and these through whose hands they pass yet if consumed at home home they cannot make any addition to the treasure of the nation therefore only of what was sent out but also of what was brought in and how consumed if gold and silver or durable commodities deserving the name of treasure be brought in as our gold and silver was gotten by foreign trade so it may likewise be consumed by it we ought therefore to use all means and join all our endeavours that to a much gaiter value than we have exported by which we have not only consumed a great part of the treasure we had but all the bullion that hath been produce of such are not all brought home but sent to some other country and consumed there and because it may be difficult to adjust how many of the goods brought because it may be difficult to adjust how many of the goods brought home are consumed here or re-exported or whether the goods exported are sent to the same place for gold and silver was carried off to pay for them and that we have thereby consumed our treasure unless we will suppose that such goods brought in tho of no solid will suppose that such goods brought in tho of no solid use or long since consumed or perished do however as well deserve to be esteemed the treasure of the nation exports so upon an examination of some particular trades it will appear that we have consumed our treasure the trades that have had the greatest over balance and is well known upon an examination of the state of our coin it will appear that we have consumed a great part of the treasure we had in the year and also what has which being but half so much as we had we may conclude that we have consumed seven millions of our silver coin since the year and as it is probable we millions of our silver coin since the year and as it is probable we have consumed so much of the coin we had so also all the silver bullion that has the year that the late war begun is year and added to the seven millions consumed of what we had makes eighteen millions tho it be true that these eleven millions was brought in by trade yet if it appear that since the year we have consumed of the coin we had ny great quantity and also the whole of what has our goods and products at least per an it should be granted that we have consumed by our bad trades what we have got by our good unless those that are increase of gold coin can make amends for the great quantity of our silver coin consumed nor any small increase of plate or jewels the improvement of our lands and increase estimated they would probably appear so inconsiderable compared with the bullion and coin we have consumed as that they would not deserve the title of an article in computations of our good marks and signs that we had ships and people and that we had not consumed all our treasure before the war but such marks and signs of strength and power strength and power ought not to be taken as a proof that we had not consumed part of our treasure before the war by foreign traffic or that we might not stored with more coin to have circulated for the payment of the charge whether we consumed more bullion by the war than was in those years brought in by trade or war than was in those years brought in by trade or whether we should have consumed by those trades which have usually carried out coin and were interrupted by the war were interrupted by the war more bullion if they had not been interrupted than was consumed by the war may sooner be disputed than decided therefore if it appear that we long as our exportations were confined to such we were secure against having our treasure consumed by trade and had it in our power to make additions by good husbandry in money be sufficient for the government and commerce and in what time it may be consumed if great encouragement be given to exportation by a prodigal consumption of foreign commodities at produce p nothing can be a clearer gain to this kingdom than the return of consumed at home because treble that sum would otherwise be carried out for foreign silks and be about per ann of which the returns might be about whereof there might be consumed at home to the value of when it comes into the second third and fourth collected from those particulars to answer or make amends for the coin and bullion we consumed in those years and if not then it must be concluded that we have decreased goods are perishable and that many of them as well as our other products were consumed at home and that therefore they ought not to be computed as an addition of reckon' as an addition to our wealth and the other three quarters allowed to be consumed but then it is expected that the same arguments shall be admitted as to perishable will appear to be inconsiderable in value compared with those species therefore if we have consumed our gold and silver it will justify the assertion that has occasioned much of this to the nation if it had been kept here will by such a trade be consumed and what brought in be in the dreyns or on the dunghill in a short ground for an inquiry to find out what bullion had been imported and exported or consumed at home if they had been altogether fictitious yet being offered only in order to the importation of bullion at per an for years as there mentioned what will remain consumed of our old stock is nine millions which it may be feared does not differ materials are sold the manufacturers work and the merchants adventure if such tobacco be not consumed at home but re-exported unless gold and silver or some durable commodities be brought in by sales abroad or out of our own people by high prizes on such goods consumed at home and whether the sending out of so much bullion annually to purchase such the stock of the nation by any part of the said twelve millions that is consumed at home but only by such part as is converted into what is lasting and we did usually send out to india which others compute to be and that we consumed much bullion for wrought plate fringe lace and being it is supposed he will own those years and in these species that was laid up in the nation and not consumed amounts to per annum but if the author will not go so far back but for gold being coined over and over for hammer' money melted down for milled money consumed or exported which increase of our coin in those years is near about the same brought into the nation in those years or in the years by trade and not consumed but either laid up in commodities in specie or converted into money or some such no manner of means be understood to get so much by what woollen goods are consumed in the nations as by what is carried to foreign markets it is not doubted been all along owned that we make no addition to our riches by what is consumed at home but it does not therefore follow that we must send out our money or if not that he would tell us not only how our wool shall be consumed but how the poor who daily increase upon us shall be employed if all the what he sent out and the shopkeeper as soon as he has sold to the consumer what he has bought of the merchant yet such computations can only discover what gain raised by customs and duties upon foreign goods imported is usually also paid by the consumer at last which taxes duties and importations all have been enabled to pay by their said tobacco be spent at home it goes from hand to hand to the last consumer to be reduced to smoke by this it may appear as well as by the ingenuity or industry or by an alteration in the humours judgment or interest of the consumers upon which trade ever had its greatest dependence yet few instances can be given when no particular relation to foreign trade because such taxes were paid by the landed-men and consumers the traders only concerned in proportion with others what was raised by customs and duties
