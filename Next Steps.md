# Current ideas for next steps

1. *Lexicon of interesting terms:* we hope to explore terms relevant to the origin and mutation of "consumption," perhaps through sentiment analysis and/or analysis of their frequency and uses in context.

2. *Compilation of cleaned EEBO csvs* into one large file or database to allow for specific querying and searches

3. *Sentiment analysis:* for the paper, terms used in the case we focus on, other intersting words

4. *Spatial visualization:* using geospatial or heat mapping techniques to visualize trade routes/trade amounts

Possibly next semester
5. *Metaphorical language:* using specific keywords/phrases from reading primary sources to work backwards for identifying figures of speech/irony/sarcasm
